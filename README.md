# Hi there! 👋 I'm Tahera, and I love building seamless web experiences.

- Right now, I'm hard at work on [trackr](https://github.com/Undisclosed64/Trackr) – an issue tracker for software and project management. Using my skills in React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I'm developing a tool that helps us manage projects.

- Learning isn't just a hobby, it's a way of life for me, and I'm always on the lookout for new things to explore. At the moment, I'm diving deep into TypeScript and NextJS.

- I'm also a technical writer at [LambdaTest](https://www.lambdatest.com) – writing about the various concepts of frontend development with an extensive focus on cross-browser compatibility and responsive design. You can find some of my work here: https://www.lambdatest.com/blog/author/taheraalam/

- If you just want to say hi or collaborate on a project, don't hesitate to drop me a line at @taheraalam532@gmail.com. I'm always excited to connect with people like you.
